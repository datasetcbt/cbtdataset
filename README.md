Research Team: The study was conducted by a team of psychologists and data scientists at the University of Mindwell. The team included Dr. Emma Turner, a clinical psychologist specializing in anxiety disorders, and Dr. David Lee, a data scientist with expertise in mental health research.

Objective: The primary goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week CBT program in reducing symptoms of generalized anxiety among university students. The study aimed to provide quantitative evidence on the impact of CBT, helping university counseling centers refine their mental health support services.

Participants:

    The study recruited 200 university students aged 18-25 from various disciplines.
    Participants were selected based on their initial scores on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale, with a focus on those scoring in the mild to moderate range.
    The group included 60% female and 40% male participants, representing a diverse mix of socioeconomic backgrounds.

Study Design:

    Participants were randomly divided into two groups: Intervention Group (100 students) and Control Group (100 students).
    The Intervention Group received weekly one-on-one CBT sessions, conducted by licensed therapists, for a duration of 8 weeks. The sessions focused on cognitive restructuring, relaxation techniques, and behavioral activation.
    The Control Group received weekly general wellness sessions that focused on stress management but did not include CBT techniques.

Data Collection:

    Pre- and Post-Intervention Assessments: Anxiety levels of all participants were assessed using the GAD-7 scale before starting the intervention and immediately after the 8-week period.
    Midpoint Check-in: A midpoint assessment was conducted after 4 weeks to monitor progress.
    Follow-Up Survey: A follow-up survey was conducted 4 weeks post-intervention to measure the persistence of any changes in anxiety levels.
    The dataset contains demographic information (age, gender, academic major), GAD-7 scores at each time point, and attendance data for each session.

Outcome:

    The dataset aims to provide insights into how CBT impacts anxiety reduction over time compared to general wellness sessions. It allows researchers and practitioners to analyze factors such as session attendance and initial anxiety levels in predicting treatment success.
    The results of this study are intended to be shared with mental health professionals and university counseling centers, guiding the development of more effective support programs for students facing anxiety.
